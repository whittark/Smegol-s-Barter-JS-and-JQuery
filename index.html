    <h1>Smeg's Barter</h1>
    <p>You want to buy a wish from Smeg, the dragon that lives in your parking garage.</p>
    <p>Smeg will tell you exactly how much your wish will cost.</p>
    <p>Luckily, you have a bag of jewels with which to pay but are unsure how much each type of jewel is worth.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Smeg is an exacting creature.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay too little and Smeg won't sell you a wish.</li>
      <li>Pay too much and you'll offend Smeg; he may eat a finger or a toe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Click the jewels to begin paying; match Smeg's price exactly and you'll get your wish! Take great care not to overpay.</p>
